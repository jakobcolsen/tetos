## Generative AI Use Disclosure
I may use ChatGPT or other generative AI agents to conduct research and potentially generate code samples. While AI generated code may end up in this project, I will **NOT** implement code that I do not fully understand. 

This is an educational personal project, I would be robbing myself of the knowledge and experience if I simply had an AI complete this for me.
